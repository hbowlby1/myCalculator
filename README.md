# myCalculator
First basic project with C# that is a functional calculator
At the moment it can only take 2 numbers and add them together.
In the future I plan to add the ability to add more numbers and better visuals

Things it can do:
It can add, subtract, multiply and divide.
It can clear numbers and the calculation type
it displays the result

Things it cannot do, yet
it does not use the keypad
it does not display the numbers when they are clicked.
it cannot utilize more than 2 numbers.
